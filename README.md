# demo spring boot from intellij community edition and run maven from WSL.
- leverage https://start.spring.io/ to prepare starter pom
- comment mvn when import into intellij to keep maven settings for WSL.
- without spring initilizer plugin for intellilj community edition, actually could leverage vscode spring boot wizard as well.
